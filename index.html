        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Football is my favourite hobby. It’s a team
sport, in which you can score only by placing
the ball inside the goal of the opposite team.
Teams content 11 players – field players and a
goalkeeper. The goalkeeper’s role is to protect
the goal. He’s the only person that can touch
the ball with his hands, but only in his penalty
area. There are also 3 men which are not
playing, these are the refferees.
• Personally I play football for both training and
fun. Many contacts with the ball improve the
technique, and moving on the pitch builds the
condition. Additionaly scoring a goal or
blocking a dangerous shot is a really nice
feeling, what makes football a good game for
minimizing the stress. It’s good to have an onfield idol, that you can watch to improve your
skills. My idol is Kaka’, because I love the way
he dribbles and passes.
• While playing, you must remember that
football is a team game. Individual actions
may be satisfying, but there’s more pleasure
from the game when you remember about the
teamwork. Moreover playing as a team is
much more effective, and when there’s
chemistry between the teammates, you can
beat stronger or even more skilled oponents.
Football is based on teamwork and that’s the
best part of it in my opinion. </p>
